Using Python along with Tkinter, we have created an application that allows sending and receiving encrypted messages using the Caesar Cipher and Atbash Cipher to individually identified users and all identified users. It includes a Login System with user and password recovery, user lockout, security questions, and error handling in case the user is not valid. Including security tests with doctest.
